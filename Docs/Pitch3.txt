We will be creating a sort of "art geoguesser" in which a user is prompted with a piece of art and must guess on a map where that art came from. We are using two API's
to do this. Firstly, the MET offers an API that gives access images and country-of-origin values of various artworks, which is where we will get the prompt and the 
correct answer. Secondly, we will use the JavaScript library Leaflet to give the user an interactive map on which they can guess the art's location of origin. Their
guess, in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates are then sent to the Google Maps API which will return the country that contains those coordinates. Users will
be rewarded for correct answers with scores attached to accounts they can create.
