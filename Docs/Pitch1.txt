idea 1: Dynamic Boston Crime Playlist

Our idea involves pulling reported data from the Citizen application. We plan on taking reporting data from the Citizen API, grabbing reports from the last 24 hours in a 5 mile radius of the user, using keywords to determine a "danger score" (ie. knife or gun appearing in a report give it more weight), and calculating the cumulative danger value of reports.

We then use the Spotify API to assign intensity values to spotify tag, assign intensity values to songs by cumulative values of tags. We then assign a "range" that a song occupies (i.e. song with an intensity value of 15 could occupy the range(13, 17)). We make playlists for each danger level and send playlists which appropriately corresponding to users.

We then compile dynamic playlists with danger values calculated from our use of the Citizen API. Songs with intensity ranger that include danger values have a chance to be added to the playlist. Each playlist has a cap of 25 songs.
